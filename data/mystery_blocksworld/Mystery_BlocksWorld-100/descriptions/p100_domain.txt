I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   action1 object
   action4 object1 object2
   action2 object
   action3 object1 object2

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform action1, the following facts need to be true: predicate1 object, predicate2 object, predicate3.
    Once action1 is performed the following facts will be true: predicate4 object.
    Once action1 is performed the following facts will be false:  predicate1 object, predicate2 object, predicate3.
    To perform action2, the following facts need to be true: predicate4 object.
    Once action2 is performed the following facts will be true: predicate1 object, predicate2 object, predicate3.    
    Once action2 is performed the following facts will be false: predicate4 object.
    To perform action3, the following needs to be true: predicate1 object2, predicate4 object1.
    Once action3 action is performed the following will be true: predicate3, predicate1 object1, predicate5 object1 object2.
    Once action3 action is performed the following will be false: predicate1 object2, predicate4 object1.
    To perform action4 action, the following needs to be true: predicate5 object1 object2, predicate1 object1, predicate3.
    Once action4 action is performed the following will be true: predicate4 object1, predicate1 object2.
    Once action4 action is performed the following will be false:, predicate5 object1 object2, predicate1 object1, predicate3.
