You must end the task with the objects in 4 clusters. The objects in one cluster are multiple of 3 that are odd and  another cluster constraints objects that are multiples of 3 and are even. The third cluster does not contain multiples of 3 but are odd, the final cluster contains objects that are not multiples of 3 but are even. The objects are clustered in order with the lowest number object in predicate2 and the highest object in predicate1.
