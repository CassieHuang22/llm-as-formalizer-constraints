(define (domain blocksworld)
;; CONSTRAINT You must end the task with the blocks in 4 stacks. The blocks in one tower are multiple of 3 that are odd and  another tower constraints blocks that are multiples of 3 and are even. The third tower does not contain multiples of 3 but are odd, the final tower contains blocks that are not multiples of 3 but are even. The towers are stacked in order with the lowest number block on the table and the highest block on top.
